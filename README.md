# Study Time Tracker

This is a simple Python program that estimates your weekly study time based on how many hours you studied today. It asks for daily study hours, safely converts the input, performs a calculation, and displays clear output. The project demonstrates basic Python programming, user input, calculations, and error handling.

## How to Run

In your terminal, run:

```
python app.py
```

or, depending on your setup:

```
python3 app.py
```

## Example Output
